"""Enforce the publication rules in PROJECT_RULES.md sections 7 and 11.

Those sections already define what may not reach the shared repository: agent
process records, personal usernames, internal addresses, absolute paths, SSH
details, credentials, and model or dataset blobs. They were written as a manual
checklist, which is why a blunt local exclude of an entire directory was
standing in for them: a directory rule cannot tell a compliant experiment
report from a leaked absolute path, so it discarded documentation while the
real traces went through untouched.

Run this against the staged set before committing, or against a commit range
before pushing to the shared branch::

    python scripts/release_gate.py
    python scripts/release_gate.py --range origin/pretrain...HEAD

Read the exit code, and do not pipe it into ``tail`` or ``head`` when chaining
with ``&&``: a pipeline reports the last command's status, so a failing gate
becomes a success and the commit proceeds. That has already happened once.
